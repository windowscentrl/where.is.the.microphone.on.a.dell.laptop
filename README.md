When using voice dictation, video calling, or audio recording apps on your laptop, you may need to adjust the volume of input devices like the microphone. The mic is typically located somewhere above the keyboard and just to the left. On most models, you’ll see a small hole with a black grille covering it from above. This is where the mic can be found on your Dell laptop. Users who frequently use their laptops for video calling or voice dictation sessions may want to adjust the volume of speech recognition software instead of muting the mic. Fortunately, locating this device is easy with some basic knowledge about laptops in general. Read on to learn more about where the microphone is on a Dell laptop and how to adjust its volume accordingly.

## How To Find the Microphone on Dell Laptops

1. Dell Audio Control Panel
 * Click the blue button for the microphone on the keyboard (which is the built-in microphone). 
 * From the Dell Audio Control Panel, go to the “Input” tab and find the option for a built-in microphone. If your laptop has a built-in microphone installed, you’ll see the “Internal Microphone” as one of the input devices. 
 * Go to the “Microphone” tab, and from here, you can speak and check the bar level to see if the microphone is catching the sound correctly. You can also customize the levels as per your convenience. 
 * Click “OK” to save the settings. 
2. Hardware and Sound 
 * Go to Control Panel on your Dell laptop by pressing Windows + S or typing “Control Panel” in the search bar.
 * Click on the “Hardware and Sound” section. 
 * Click on the “Sound” section and then go to the “Recording” tab.
 * From here, you can see the “Microphone Array” option. This is the internal microphone; you can see the levels in front of it. Speak near your laptop, either in front or near the camera, to check the microphone’s location. 

## How do I know if my Dell computer has a microphone?

* Click on the section called Hardware and Sound.
* Click on Sound and then switch to the Recording tab.
* You should see a microphone called Microphone Array or something similar to that. When you speak near your machine the audio levels to the right should increase.
